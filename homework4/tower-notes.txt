Problem 3 - Ambiguous Puzzle
The first pair of ambiguous puzzles that was found was:

[[1, 2, 3, 4],
 [2, 1, 4, 3],
 [3, 4, 1, 2],
 [4, 3, 2, 1]]

[[1, 2, 3, 4],
 [2, 4, 1, 3],
 [3, 1, 4, 2]
 [4, 3, 2, 1]]

This puzzle is ambiguous because counts list will be
identical for both puzzles.
