<h1>Homework 6. Choose a language for a flynetting swarm</h1>

<p><small>[<a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall19/cs131/index.html">131 home</a> &gt; <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall19/cs131/homework.html">Homework</a>]</small></p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>You’re working for XuFly, a startup company that intends to build
swarms of tiny flying robots that will kill insects. The robots are
intended for use in areas like farmers’ markets where swarms of
insects are common and where conventional chemical treatments are not
allowed. The idea is that each swarm of robots will be equipped with
nets that capture flying insects.  A planned, more-advanced version of
the robot swarms will sport flyswatters to handle insects that are not
flying.</p>

<p>Your boss has assigned you the job of writing the code that runs in
the robots. The robots’ processors will be equipped with
low-power CPUs and AI accelerators to implement the algorithms to
recognize flying insects (and eventually, stationary insects) and to
control the robots’ actions. Robot swarms will divide, merge, and
collaborate as necessary to control insects as efficiently as
possible. When a robot runs low on power it will fly to a charging
station and charge itself back up.</p>

<p>The code that you’re in charge of will need to operate many
algorithms, some involving machine-learning-based recognition and some
involving cooperation. For example, your boss is interested in having
you try the swarm gradient bug algorithm (SGBA). See:
McGuire KN, De Wagter C, Tuyls K, Kappen HJ, de Croon GCHE.

navigation solution for a swarm of tiny flying robots to explore an
unknown environment</a>. <em>Sci Robot</em>. 2019;4(35):eaaw9710.
doi:<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/scirobotics.aaw9710">10.1126/scirobotics.aaw9710</a>.</p>

<p>Your company has previously prototyped robots by writing C++ code,
but this effort has had the usual problems with buggy programs
containing invalid address, race conditions, and the like, and your
boss is interested in possibly choosing a better language for this set
of applications since you’ll need to write these applications from
scratch – or maybe you’ll just stick with C++. Also, your
company would like to choose hardware that is cost-effective and
cheap, and wants the ability to switch suppliers between one robot
model and the next; it would not like to be tied down to any
particular supplier due to its choice of programming language.</p>

<p>Here are some potential technologies that your company may use,
and would like your language choice to work well with:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://coral.ai/products/som/">Coral SoM</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-xavier-nx/">Jetson Xavier NX</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/11/introducing-next-generation-on-device.html">MobileNetV3 and MobileNetEdgeTPU</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-speeds-ai-development-deployment-performance-new-class-ai-hardware-cloud-edge/">Movidius VPU (2020 version)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit">OpenVINO</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite">TensorFlow Lite</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt">TensorRT</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Assignment</h2>

<p>Review the abovementioned sources, and any other that seem relevant for
this application, and compare and contrast the following languages as
candidates for the code that XuFly will write for its flying robots:</p>

<ul>
  <li>C++</li>
  <li><a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a></li>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>Python</li>
</ul>

<p>You already know C++, Java and Python from previous classes or assignments.
Familiarize yourself with Go enough to write and test a simple
function <samp>everyNth</samp> that accepts
a <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/container/list/">list</a> L and a
positive integer N and returns a new list containing every Nth element
of L, starting with the (N−1)st (counting from zero) element,
then the (2N−1)st element, and so on until L’s elements are
exhausted so that the returned list’s size is ⌊len(L) /
N⌋ (where ⌊<var>x</var>⌋ is
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions">floor</a>
of <var>x</var>). The method should accept any list and should consume
O(len(L)) time and O(len(L)/N) space. Put your function into a
file <samp>everyNth.go</samp> that tests your function on a list of
the first 1000 nonnegative integers and on an N equal to 109, and
which prints the integers in the resulting list, one per line.  The
shell command <samp>go build &amp;&amp; ./everyNth</samp> should test your
program.
</p>

<p>Do some research on your four languages and support software as a
potential platform. Your research should include an examination of the
language and system documentation to help determine whether it would
be effective. We want an alternative that supports the proposed
application well.
</p>

<p>We are not expecting working prototypes for the proposed application.</p>

<p>Write an executive summary that compares the four alternate
approaches to each other. The
summary should be in 10-point font or larger and should be at most
three pages. You can put references and appendixes in later pages, if
you can’t get under the page limit otherwise: the appendixes should contain
any source code or diagrams. Your summary should focus on the
technologies’ effects on ease of use, flexibility, generality,
performance, reliability; thie idea is to explore the most-important
technical challenges in doing the proposed rewrite. The summary should
be suitable for software executives, that is, for readers who have
some expertise in software, particularly in managing software
developers, but who are not experts in the
languages. Please keep the <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall19/cs131/comm.html">resources for written
reports and oral presentations</a> in mind, particularly its rubrics
and its advice for citations to sources that you consulted.</p>

<h2>Submit</h2>

<p>Submit a file <samp>hw6.pdf</samp> containing your summary. Submit
your <samp>everyNth</samp> implementation and test, along with any
other prototype code, as a compressed tarball <samp>hw6.tar.gz</samp>
in the usual way. Your tarball should include a simple
<samp>Makefile</samp> such that the command <samp>make check</samp>
builds and runs your test case. You can augment the makefile
to build and run any other prototype code you submit.</p>
